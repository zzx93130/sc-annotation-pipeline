# Human Lung Single-Cell Annotation Marker Panel (v2)

**Scope:** Human lung scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq, including healthy lung and disease contexts such as interstitial lung disease (ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).  
**Status:** Curated candidate panel for annotation and review; not a dataset-validated classifier.  
**Principle:** Distinguish lineage (L1), cell identity/subtype (L2), and potentially overlapping transcriptional states (L3).

The markers below are **sets of supporting evidence, not mandatory co-expression lists**. Single-cell dropout, differences between scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq, disease-associated remodeling, and anatomical sampling must be considered. The `Notes` beneath a class are part of its interpretation.

## L1 — Compartment and lineage markers

```yaml
Epithelial:
  markers: [EPCAM]

Blood endothelial:
  markers: [PECAM1, CDH5, CLDN5, VWF, RAMP2]

Lymphatic endothelial:
  markers: [PROX1, FLT4, MMRN1, CCL21, PDPN]

Fibroblast:
  markers: [PDGFRA, DCN, LUM, COL1A2, COL3A1]

Mural:
  markers: [PDGFRB, RGS5, ACTA2, MYH11, TAGLN]

Myeloid:
  markers: [LYZ, TYROBP, FCER1G, AIF1, SPI1]
  neutrophil_support: [S100A8, S100A9, FCGR3B]

Lymphoid:
  T_lineage: [CD3D, TRAC, CD2]
  B_lineage: [CD79A, MS4A1]
  NK_lineage: [KLRD1, NKG7, GNLY, NCR1]

Mast:
  markers: [TPSAB1, TPSB2, CPA3, MS4A2]

Mesothelial:
  markers: [MSLN, UPK3B, CALB2, WT1]
```

**L1 interpretation:** Lymphoid is the union of T-, B-, and NK-lineage evidence, not a single co-expression signature. The mural lineage likewise combines smooth muscle and pericyte markers and must be resolved at L2. Blood and lymphatic endothelial cells may be handled as sibling L1 categories or nested under an overarching endothelial parent, provided the hierarchy remains consistent.

```

## Annotation decision rules

| Rule | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **1. Confirm lineage first** | Assign an L2 identity and L3 program only after sufficient L1 evidence supports its parent lineage. |
| **2. Score sibling specificity** | Require markers that discriminate the proposed subtype from competing subtypes within the same compartment, not merely a high absolute signature score. |
| **3. Check differential expression** | Compare the proposed signature with cluster-versus-rest DE genes, detection rates, and effect sizes. |
| **4. Evaluate negative evidence** | Reject or downgrade labels when a competing lineage/subtype explains the transcriptome better. |
| **5. Keep states parallel** | Take L3 programs as parallel to identity. |
| **6. Fail upward** | Return to a validated parent type if subtype evidence is inadequate. |
| **7. Audit small clusters** | Inspect the top 10–30 DE genes, potential doublets, ambient RNA, sample distribution, and biological coherence. |
| **8. Validate externally** | Compare final labels with reference mapping (e.g., HLCA) and manually inspect DotPlots/feature plots for discrepant clusters. |
